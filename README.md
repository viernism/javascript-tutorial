## Introduction
<p align="justify">
    Just a crash course. You can straight up learn Node, and React if you read and try this tutorial thoroughly. Of course this tutorial didn't have those detailed bits about every methods for string and arrays but it'll do the job if you want to learn Node or React after reading this(maybe i hope so)
